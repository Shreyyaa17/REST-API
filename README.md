This is a beginner-friendly REST API project where I practiced and understood the core concepts of API development, including the use of HTTP methods like GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH.
I used Postman to test the endpoints and ensure proper request-response handling.

🚀 Features:
Fetch data using GET
Add new data using POST
Update existing data using PATCH
Delete data using DELETE

🛠️ Tools & Tech:
Node.js / Express (or mention your stack)
Postman for API testing

This project helped me build a solid foundation for creating and interacting with RESTful APIs.
